# Privacy Policy

Last Updated August 13, 2024

Welcome to our Privacy Policy page. This document outlines the privacy practices of our website.

- **Website Technology**: This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) , a [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). It does not use cookies. We utilize `localStorage`[^1] solely for managing light and dark themes on the client side, with no server interaction. As such, there are no forms or mechanisms that handle personal data.

- **Hosting**: Our website is hosted by Vercel. Vercel may collect user personal information, including IP address logs, for legal compliance and to maintain the security and integrity of the website and services. For more information, please refer to [Vercel's Privacy Statement](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy).

- **DNS Services**: We use Cloudflare for DNS services[^2]. For details on how Cloudflare handles data, please review their [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

- **External Links**: All external links open in a new tab and are configured not to send referrer information in the header. We do not use anonymizing services, so you will know exactly where each link will take you. Additionally, we use the `noopener` attribute to prevent the new page from accessing the original page. If any external links are missing the `rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"`[^3] attribute, [let us know](mailto:hy@andka.my.id) and we will update them promptly.

- **User Tracking and Analytics**: We do not implement any user tracking or analytics on this site. Our website exists solely for personal satisfaction, and we have no interest in tracking site popularity. Therefore, no data is collected, stored, or analyzed. There are no advertisements, tracking mechanisms, or analyticsâ€”just content for your reading pleasure.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:hy@andka.my.id).
